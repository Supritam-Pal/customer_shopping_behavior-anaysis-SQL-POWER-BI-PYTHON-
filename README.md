This project provides a complete analysis of **customer shopping behavior** using a combination of  
**SQL (data extraction & cleaning)**, **Python (EDA & preprocessing)**, and **Power BI (data visualization)**.

The goal is to understand how customers interact with products, shipping types, and subscriptions,  
and to derive insights for improving sales, marketing, and inventory strategies.
